How to upgrade from `z3c.testsetup` < 0.3
=========================================

With the 0.3 release of `z3c.testsetup` the set of valid marker
strings changed, introducing support for file-dependent setups,
layers, etc.

If you still mark your testfiles with the ``:Test-Layer:`` marker,
update your testfiles as follows:

- ``:Test-Layer: unit``

  Change to: ``:doctest:``

- ``:Test-Layer: python``

  Change to: ``:unittest:``

- ``:Test-Layer: functional``

  Change to: ``:functional-zcml-layer: <ZCML-FILE>``

  The ZCML file must explicitly be given.

If you used custom setups passed to ``register_all_tests``, consider
declaring those setup/teardown functions in the appropriate doctest
files using ``:setup:`` and ``:teardown:``.

You might also get better structured test suites when using the new
layer markers ``:layer:``, ``:zcml-layer:`` and
``functional-zcml-layer:``.

Try to get rid of all parameters passed to ``register_all_tests``
except those, mentioned in ``README.txt``.
