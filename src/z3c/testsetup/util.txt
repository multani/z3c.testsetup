Utilities for z3c.testsetup
===========================

The `util` module defines some helper functions of general use.

get_package(pkg_or_dotted_name)
-------------------------------

For most classes in this package, that accept packages as arguments,
these packages can be delivered as real packages or as strings
containing dotted names. To get a package of something, that is either
a string with dotted names or a real package, the `get_package`
function is provided.

Such we can get a package from a dotted name string::

   >>> from z3c.testsetup.util import get_package
   >>> get_package('z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')
   <module 'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave' from '...'>

The dotted name string can be unicode::

   >>> get_package(u'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')
   <module 'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave' from '...'>

We can indeed pass a package as argument::

   >>> from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave
   >>> get_package(cave)
   <module 'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave' from '...'>


get_keyword_params(class, method_name)
--------------------------------------

The ``get_keyword_params()`` function tries to extract all keyword
parameters of a given method of a class. We want to know, which
keyword parameters are supported by the constructor of the following
class::

   >>> class Club(object):
   ...     def __init__(self, weight, num_of_spikes=0):
   ...         pass

This can be done by::

   >>> from z3c.testsetup.util import get_keyword_params
   >>> kw_list = get_keyword_params(Club, '__init__')
   >>> kw_list.sort()
   >>> kw_list
   ['num_of_spikes']

Okay. Note, that we only get the keyword parameters, i.e. parameters,
that have a default value.

What now, if the class was derived and supports more parameters
than actually shown in the class definition itself? First, let us
create such a class::

   >>> class ColouredClub(Club):
   ...     def __init__(self, weight, color='pink', **kw):
   ...         pass

A coloured club can therefore have a number of spikes and a
color. Will both be found by our helper function?::

   >>> kw_list = get_keyword_params(ColouredClub, '__init__')
   >>> kw_list.sort()
   >>> kw_list
   ['color', 'num_of_spikes']

Fine.

Now we check, wether only really accepted parameters are found. What,
if a derived class does not accept various keywords using ``**kw`` or
similar? We define such a class::

   >>> class ClubSoda(Club):
   ...    def __init__(self, temperature=12, sparkles=True, *args):
   ...        pass

This time, the ``num_of_spikes`` parameter should not appear. The
``weight`` parameter, which is derived from the base class, should
neighter appear::

   >>> kw_list = get_keyword_params(ClubSoda, '__init__')
   >>> kw_list.sort()
   >>> kw_list
   ['sparkles', 'temperature']


get_marker_from_string
----------------------

Looks for a markerstring in a string and returns the found value or
`None`. A markerstring has the form::

  :<Tag>: <Value>

We define a marker string::

   >>> markerstring = """Some text
   ... 
   ... :Test-Layer: foo
   ...
   ... Some other text
   ... """

Now let's lookup the value of the marker `Test-Layer`::

   >>> from z3c.testsetup.util import get_marker_from_string
   >>> get_marker_from_string('Test-Layer', markerstring)
   u'foo'

Another marker cannot be found::

   >>> get_marker_from_string('Not-there', markerstring) is None
   True

It does not matter, whether the marker string starts at the beginning
of a line. Also several whitespaces between the marker string and the
applied value are accepted. The tag in the marker can be written with
upper or lower case letters or both in a wild mix::

   >>> markerstring = """Some text
   ... 
   ...    :TeSt-lAyEr:        foo
   ...
   ... Some other text
   ... """
   >>> get_marker_from_string('test-Layer', markerstring)
   u'foo'


get_marker_from_file
--------------------

Looks for a markerstring  in a file and returns the found value or
`None`. A markerstring has the form::

  :<Tag>: <Value>

We define a marker string and put it into a file::

   >>> markerstring = """Some text
   ... 
   ...    :TeSt-lAyEr:        foo
   ...
   ... Some other text
   ... """

   >>> open('tempfile', 'w').writelines(markerstring)
   >>> import os
   >>> os.path.isfile('tempfile')
   True

Now we lookup the marker string from this file::

   >>> from z3c.testsetup.util import get_marker_from_file
   >>> get_marker_from_file('tEsT-LaYeR', 'tempfile')
   u'foo'

If the string does not exist, we get `None`::

   >>> get_marker_from_file('Senseless', 'tempfile') is None
   True
   
We remove the file to clean up::

   >>> os.unlink('tempfile')

"""
