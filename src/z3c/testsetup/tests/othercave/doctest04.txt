A functional doctest with ZCML-layer
====================================

:doctest:
:functional-zcml-layer: ftesting.zcml

We didn't define a real environment in ftesting.zcml, but in
functional tests certain often needed functions should be available
automatically::

  >>> getRootFolder()
  <zope.app.folder.folder.Folder object at 0x...>
