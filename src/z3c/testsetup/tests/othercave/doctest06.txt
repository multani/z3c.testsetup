Another functional doctest with ZCML-layer
==========================================

This is the second doctest with a functional ZCML layer applied. We
want to make sure, that both are run in the same layer.

:doctest:
:functional-zcml-layer: ftesting.zcml

We didn't define a real environment in ftesting.zcml, but in
functional tests certain often needed functions should be available
automatically::

  >>> getRootFolder
  <function getRootFolder at 0x...>
