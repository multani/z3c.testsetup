Functional doctest with different ZCML-layer
============================================

This is a doctest that uses a different ZCML file than the other ones
in this package.

:doctest:
:functional-zcml-layer: ftesting2.zcml

We didn't define a real environment in ftesting.zcml, but in
functional tests certain often needed functions should be available
automatically::

  >>> getRootFolder
  <function getRootFolder at 0x...>
