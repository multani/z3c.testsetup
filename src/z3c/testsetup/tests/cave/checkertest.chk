:Test-Layer: checker

First we check, whether the <SOME NUMBER OF> term is matched by the
modified checker::

   >>> print "%s seconds" % 0.123
   <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds

Then we check the <SOME ADDRESS> term::

   >>> print "A memory address at 0x1a0322ff"
   A memory address at <SOME ADDRESS>

That's it.
