===================================
Testsetups without zope.app.testing
===================================

In some packages zope.app.testing might not be available or it is not
wanted. This is important for ``z3c.testsetup`` because functional
tests require that package for setup, etc. For example when it comes
to plain Python packages. 

The ``z3c.testsetup`` package in this case should provide us reduced
sets of test collectors automatically and run all but the functional
tests.

To simulate this, we removed ``zope.app.testing`` from the registered
modules in ``sys.modules`` before running this testfile and reloaded
the z3c.testsetup package. The latter is necessary, because
z3c.testsetup decides on import time, whether zope.app.testing is
available and then provides different testgetters and -collectors.

We can see this when we do a testsetup, that would normally include
functional tests. Consider the example given in the
``samplesetup_short0.py`` setup file, which is located in the ``cave``
package of the ``tests``::

    >>> import os
    >>> cavepath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'tests', 'cave')
    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short0.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests('z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')

It is the same setup file, that we used in testrunner.txt (at the very
beginning). Using it there (with ``zope.app.testing`` available), this
setup found four (successful) tests, of which two were functional
ones.

The only difference now is, that we have no ``zope.app.testing`` and
therefore no machinery for functional tests. We can check that
beforehand by looking at the testgetters defined in the general test
collector::

    >>> import z3c.testsetup
    >>> from z3c.testsetup import TestCollector
    >>> tc = z3c.testsetup.TestCollector.handled_getters
    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> pprint(sorted([str(x) for x in tc]))
    ["<class 'z3c.testsetup.testgetter.PythonTestGetter'>",
     "<class 'z3c.testsetup.testgetter.SimpleDocTestGetter'>",
     "<class 'z3c.testsetup.testgetter.UnitDocTestGetter'>"]

What is missing here, is the FunctionalDocTestGetter that normally
appears here. As a result there will be less tests found and run by
the testrunner::

    >>> import sys
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short0$',
    ...     ]
    >>> sys.argv = 'test '.split()
    >>> from z3c.testsetup import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in ... seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in ... seconds.
    False

As we can see, only unit test were run and no functional ones anymore.

After making zope.app.testing available again, we should get a
different result::

    >>> sys.path[:] = globals()['saved-sys-info'][0]
    >>> sys.modules.update(globals()['saved-sys-info'][2])
    >>> z3c.testsetup = __import__('z3c.testsetup')
    >>> from z3c.testsetup import TestCollector
    >>> tc = TestCollector.handled_getters
    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> pprint(sorted([str(x) for x in tc]))
    ["<class 'z3c.testsetup.functional.testgetter.FunctionalDocTestGetter'>",
     "<class 'z3c.testsetup.testgetter.PythonTestGetter'>",
     "<class 'z3c.testsetup.testgetter.SimpleDocTestGetter'>",
     "<class 'z3c.testsetup.testgetter.UnitDocTestGetter'>"]
