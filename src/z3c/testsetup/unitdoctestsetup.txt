Unit Doctest Setup
==================

``UnitDocTestSetup`` helps to find and setup unit doctests contained
in a package. The most important method therefore might be
``getTestSuite()``, which searches a given package for doctest files
and returns all tests found as a suite of unit tests.

Unit doctest setups find and register only doctests. Those tests can
also be Python modules but if you defined real `unittest.TestCase`
classes in your tests, then you most likely have 'normal' Python unit
tests. Please see 'pythontestsetup.txt' in this case. For more complex
doctests, that require a more or less complex framework setup, for
example for browser tests, to be done for each test, the setups
described in 'functionaldoctestsetup.txt' might suit your needs
better.

There are also real 'oneliners' possible, that wrap around the classes
described here. See 'README.txt' to learn more about that.

The work is done mainly in two stages:

1) The package is searched for appropriate docfiles, based on the
   settings of instcance attributes.

2) The tests contained in the found docfiles are setup as unit tests
   and added to a ``unittest.TestSuite`` instance.

There are plenty of default values active, if you use instances of
this class without further modifications. Therefore we will first
discuss the default behaviour and afterwards show, how you can modify
this behaviour to suit your special expectations on the tests.


Setting up a simple test suite
------------------------------

We want to register the doctests contained in the local ``cave``
package. This can be simply archieved by doing::

   >>> from z3c.testsetup import UnitDocTestSetup
   >>> setup = UnitDocTestSetup('z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')
   >>> setup
   <z3c.testsetup.doctesting.UnitDocTestSetup object at 0x...>   

Apparently the package to handle was passed as a string in 'dotted
name' notation. We could also pass the package itself, if it was
loaded before::

   >>> from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave
   >>> setup = UnitDocTestSetup(cave)
   >>> setup
   <z3c.testsetup.doctesting.UnitDocTestSetup object at 0x...>   

This setup is ready for use::

   >>> suite = setup.getTestSuite()
   >>> suite
   <unittest.TestSuite tests=[...]>

To sum it up, writing a test setup for a project now can be that
short::

   import z3c.testsetup
   def test_suite():
       setup = z3c.testsetup.UnitTestSetup('z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')
       return setup.getTestSuite()

This will find all .rst and .txt files in the package that provide a
certain signature (see below), register the contained tests as unit
tests and run them as part of a `unittest.TestSuite`.

Note: in many test setups you will find a code fragment like the
      following at the end of file::

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            unittest.main(default='test_suite')

      This is not neccessary for usual testrunner setups. A testrunner
      will look for appropriate filenames (modules) and if those
      modules provide a callable ``test_suite`` (usually a function)
      this callable will be called to deliver a test suite.



UnitDocTestSetup default values
-------------------------------

Understanding the defaults is important, because the default values
are driving the whole process of finding and registering the test.


Which files are found by default?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically, all files are accepted that

1) reside inside the package passed to the constructor. This includes
   subdirectories.

2) have a filename extension `.txt` or `.rst` (uppercase, lowercase
   etc. does not matter).

3) are *not* located inside a 'hidden' directory (i.e. a directory
   starting with a dot ('.'). Also subdirectories of 'hidden'
   directories are skipped.

4) contain a ReStructured Text meta-marker somewhere, that defines the
   file as a unit test (and not: functional test) explicitly::

       :Test-Layer: unit

   This means: there *must* be a line like the above one in the
   doctest file. The term might be preceeded or followed by whitspace
   characters (spaces, tabs).

Only files, that meet all four conditions are searched for unit
doctests. You can modify this behaviour of course, which will be
explained below in detail.


What options are set by default?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many options can be set, when registering unit doctests. When using
the default set of options, the following values are set::

* The setup-instance's ``setUp``-method is set as the ``setUp``
  function.

* The setup-instance's ``tearDown``-method is set as the ``tearDown``
  function.
  
     >>> setup.setUp
     <bound method UnitDocTestSetup.setUp of
      <z3c.testsetup.doctesting.UnitDocTestSetup object at 0x...>>

* The setup-instance's `optionsflags` attribute is passed. It
  includes by default the following doctest constants:

     >>> from zope.testing import doctest
     >>> setup.optionflags == (doctest.ELLIPSIS+
     ...                       doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE |
     ...                       doctest.REPORT_NDIFF)
     True

* Furthermore, additional keyword parameters are passed, which were
  set when calling the constructor. These keywords are stored in the
  setup object as `additional_options`. Those are empty by default::

     >>> setup.additional_options
     {}

No other options/parameters are set by default.


Customizing unit test setup:
----------------------------

You can modify the behaviour of grok.testing.UnitTestSetup such, that
a different set of files is registered and/or the found tests are
registered with a different set of parameters/options. We will first
discuss modifying the set of files to be searched.


Customizing the doctest file search:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The searching of appropriate doctest files is basically done by the
base class `BasicTestSetup`. Its purpose is to determine the set of
files in a package, that contain unit tests. See the testfile
`basicsetup.py` to learn more about the procedure.

The unit test setup, however, requires that files contain the above
mentioned ReStructured Text meta-marker::

    `:Test-Layer: unit`

This is determined by a list of regular expressions, which is also
available as an object attribute::

    >>> setup.regexp_list
    ['^\\s*:(T|t)est-(L|l)ayer:\\s*(unit)\\s*']

This is the default value of unit test setups.

There is one file in the `cave` subpackage, which includes that
marker. We can get the list of test files using
`getDocTestFiles()``::

    >>> testfile_list = setup.getDocTestFiles()
    >>> testfile_list
    ['...file1.rst']

    >>> len(testfile_list)
    1

The ``isTestFile()`` method of our setup object did the filtering
here::

    >>> setup.isTestFile(testfile_list[0])
    True

The `regexp_list` attribute of a ``UnitDocTestSetup`` contains a
list of regular expressions, of which each one must at least match one
line of a searched file to be accepted. If you want to include files
with different marker-strings, just change this attribute. The value
will influence behaviour of the `isTestFile()``, ``getDocTestFiles()``
and ``getTestSuite()`` methods.

Note: in practice in the current code, it is always only one regex...

If you need more complex checks here, you can derive your customized
test setup class and overwrite ``isTestFile()``.

See `basicsetup.py` for further methods how to modify test file
search, for example by choosing another set of accepted filename
extensions.


Customizing the unit test setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To customize the setup of your tests, just modify the appropriate
attributes as explained before.

To setup a different setUp or tearDown function, you can define a
derived class, that overwrites these methods.

A convenient way to pass keyword parameters to the test setup, which
do not appear in the attributes, is passing these keywords (and the
values) to the constructor::

    >>> encoded_setup = UnitDocTestSetup(cave,
    ...                                  encoding='utf-8')

This will read all doctests 'utf-8' encoded, which allow umlauts and
similar chars in tests. Note, however, that you can archieve this very
special behaviour also by writing an appropriate encoding string in
the head of the doctest file.

All keywords passed to the constructor (except 'filter_func' and
'extensions') are also given to each individual test setup 'as-is'.
