z3c.testsetup and layers
========================

Here we discuss complete testsetups that involve test layers. Test
layers are a method to group several tests or test suites in groups.

Layers are a method to do time-consuming setups like initializing
databases or whatever only once for a whole bunch of tests. Such you
can save time and make your testing setup less error-prone.

See `layered_cave/layer.py` for examples of working layers. We will
use the layers defined there in the following examples.

Simple unit doctests with layers
--------------------------------

Using z3c.testsetup, we can define quite complex testsetups with only
two lines of code::

    >>> import os
    >>> cavepath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'tests', 
    ...   'layered_cave')
    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'layeredsetup01.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    from z3c.testsetup import register_all_tests
    test_suite = register_all_tests('z3c.testsetup.tests.layered_cave')

This means, that we want to register all tests (doctests and 'normal'
python tests) from the ``layered_cave`` package, whose name we passed in
dotted name notation as a string. This is enough information for a
testrunner.

In one of the test files we declared, that a layer should be used::

    >>> testfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'adoctest.txt')
    >>> print open(testfile, 'r').read()
    This is a doctest
    =================
    <BLANKLINE>
    This doctest will be applied to a layer.
    <BLANKLINE>
    :Test-Layer: unit
    :Test-Layerdef: z3c.testsetup.tests.layered_cave.layer.UnitLayer1
    ...

The line saying `:Test-Layerdef:` tells, that we want the layer
denoted by the trailing dotted name should be applied to the tests of
the file. It is vital that the denoted object really exist. The format
of the layer declaration is::

  :Test-Layerdef: <dotted.name.of.layer.definition>

where the marker string can be written in upper or lower or mixed
case. Doing so, the testrunner will apply the declared layer to our
tests::

    >>> import sys
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^layeredsetup01$',
    ...     ]
    >>> sys.argv = 'test -f'.split()
    >>> from zope.testing import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup.tests.layered_cave.layer.FunctionalLayer1 tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup...yered_cave.layer.FunctionalLayer1 in ... seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Running z3c.testsetup.tests.layered_cave.layer.UnitLayer1 tests:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup...red_cave.layer.FunctionalLayer1 in ... seconds.
      Set up z3c.testsetup...layered_cave.layer.UnitLayer1 in ... seconds.
        Running testSetUp of UnitLayer1
        Running testTearDown of UnitLayer1
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup...layered_cave.layer.UnitLayer1 in ... seconds.
    Total: 2 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in ... seconds.
    False

As we can see, the layer `UnitLayer1` was executed here.
