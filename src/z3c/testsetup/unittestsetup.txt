Unit Test Setup
===============

``UnitTestSetup`` helps to find and setup unit tests contained in a
package. The most important method therefore might be
``getTestSuite()``, which searches a given package for modules with
unittests and returns all tests found as a suite of unit tests.

This setup type does *not* look for doctests! Only 'real' python
tests, i.e. python files with ``unittest.TestCase`` classes are found.

The work is done mainly in two stages:

1) The package is searched for appropriate modules, based on the
   settings of instcance attributes.

2) The tests contained in the found modules are setup as unit tests
   and added to a ``unittest.TestSuite`` instance.

There are some default values active, if you use instances of
this class without further modifications. Therefore we will first
discuss the default behaviour and afterwards show, how you can modify
this behaviour to suit your special expectations on the tests.


Setting up a simple test suite
------------------------------

We want to register the tests contained in the local ``cave``
package. This has to be imported first, because we need the package as
a parameter for the testsetup constructor::

    >>> from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave

Using the ``UnitTestSetup`` then is easy::

    >>> from z3c.testsetup import UnitTestSetup
    >>> setup = UnitTestSetup(cave)
    >>> setup
    <z3c.testsetup.testing.UnitTestSetup object at 0x...>   

This setup is ready for use::

    >>> suite = setup.getTestSuite()
    >>> suite
    <unittest.TestSuite tests=[...]>

To sum it up, writing a test setup for a zope 3 project now can be that
short::

   import unittest
   import z3c.testsetup
   import cave
   def test_suite():
       setup = z3c.testsetup.UnitTestSetup(cave)
       return setup.getTestSuite()

This will find all modules in the package that provide a
certain signature (see below), register the contained tests as unit
tests and run them as part of a `unittest.TestSuite`.

Note: in many test setups you will find a code fragment like the
      following at the end of file::

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            unittest.main(default='test_suite')

      This is not neccessary for usual testrunner setups. A testrunner
      will look for appropriate filenames (modules) and if those
      modules provide a callable ``test_suite`` (usually a function)
      this callable will be called to deliver a test suite.


UnitTestSetup default values
----------------------------

Understanding the defaults is important, because the default values
are driving the whole process of finding and registering the test.


Which modules are found by default?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically, all modules are accepted that

1) reside inside the package passed to the constructor. This includes
   subpackages.

2) contain a ReStructured Text meta-marker in their module docstring,
   that defines the module as a testing module
   explicitly::

       :unittest:

   This means: there *must* be a line like the above one in the
   docstring of the module (not: docstring of a class or function
   therein). The term might be preceeded or followed by whitspace
   characters (spaces, tabs).

   .. note:: What about ``:Test-Layer: python``?

      This marker was used in former releases of ``z3c.testsetup``. It
      currently still works but is deprecated now.

   For example a module `example.py` would be found if it contains::

      """
      Tests to foo.

      :unittest:
      """
      import unittest

      class TestSomething(unittest.TestCase):
          def testOne(self):
              self.assertEqual(2, 1+1)

   because the docstring of the *module* contains the required string.


Only files, that meet both conditions are found and registered. You
can modify this behaviour of course, which will be explained below in
detail.

Customizing unit test setup:
----------------------------

You can modify the behaviour of z3c.testsetup.UnitTestSetup such, that
a different set of modules is registered.


Customizing the test module search:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The unit test setup requires that files contain the above mentioned
ReStructured Text meta-marker::

    `:unittest:`

There is one file in the `cave` subpackage, which includes that
marker. We can get the list of test files using
`getTestFiles()``::

    >>> testfile_list = setup.getModules()
    >>> testfile_list
    [<module 'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.file1' from ...>]

    >>> len(testfile_list)
    1

The ``isTestModule()`` method of our setup object did the filtering
here::

    >>> from martian.scan import module_info_from_module
    >>> setup.isTestModule(module_info_from_module(testfile_list[0]))
    True

The `notatest2` module in `cave` does not contain a unit test marker::

    >>> from z3c.testsetup.tests.cave import notatest2
    >>> setup.isTestModule(module_info_from_module(notatest2))
    False

The `regexp_list` attribute of a ``UnitTestSetup`` contains a
list of regular expressions, of which each one must at least match one
line of a searched file to be accepted. If you want to include files
with different marker-strings, just change this attribute. The value
will influence behaviour of the `isTestModule()``, ``getDocTestFiles()``
and ``getTestSuite()`` methods.

If you need more complex checks here, you can derive your customized
test setup class and overwrite ``isTestModule()``.


Import errors
-------------

Python unittest files with an import error should not ever fail silently.  Due
to our internal handling, z3c.testsetup cannot pass the broken modules to the
actual testrunner (which would report them just fine as broken).  Instead, we
have to print a warning ourselves.

    >>> from z3c.testsetup.tests import importerrorcave
    >>> setup = UnitTestSetup(importerrorcave)
    >>> setup
    <z3c.testsetup.testing.UnitTestSetup object at 0x...>   
    >>> setup.getModules()
    Import error in .../importerrorcave/broken_test_mod.py
    Import error in .../importerrorcave/broken_test_mod2.py
    []

Note that this visible warning was added in z3c.testsetup 0.6 and higher,
tests import error failures were effectively hidden in older versions.
