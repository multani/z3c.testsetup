Setup examples
==============

Here we discuss complete test setups for the `cave` package contained
in the `tests` directory. We will run the `zope.testing.testrunner`
and examine their output.

Short setups
------------

Using z3c.testsetup, we can define quite complex testsetups with only
two lines of code::

    >>> import os
    >>> import z3c.testsetup
    >>> pkgpath = os.path.dirname(z3c.testsetup.__file__)
    >>> cavepath = os.path.join(pkgpath, 'tests', 'cave')
    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short0.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests('z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')

We clear the commandline, because all parameters passed to the
commandline would otherwise be applied to the examples herein::

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.argv = [sys.argv[0],]

This means, that we want to register all tests (doctests and 'normal'
python tests) from the ``cave`` package, whose name we passed in
dotted name notation as a string. This is enough information for a
testrunner::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short0$',
    ...     ]
    >>> from z3c.testsetup import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup.functional.doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c...functional.doctesting.FunctionalLayer in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down z3c...functional.doctesting.FunctionalLayer ...
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 4 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False

Of the four tests apparently run, there is one 'normal' python test
and three doctests, of which two are functional doctests.

Now, we only want to run the doctests in the ``cave`` package. A
suitable setup is contained in `samplesetup_short1.py`` in the
``cave`` package::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short1.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    <BLANKLINE>
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_doctests('z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')

This means, that we want to register all doctests from the ``cave``
package, whose name we passed in dotted name notation as a
string. This is enough information for a testrunner::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short1$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup.functional.doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer ...
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 3 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False

In the above setup the handled package was given as a string with
dotted name notation. We can instead also pass the package itself, if
it was loaded before. This results in a slight longer example::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short2.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave
    <BLANKLINE>
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_doctests(cave)


Here we register all doctests from the ``cave`` module. Let's start a
testrunner with this setup::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short2$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup.functional.doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer ...
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 3 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False

Now let's run a suite of 'normal' python unit tests, i.e. tests, that
are not doctests. An appropriate setup file might look like this::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short3.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave
    <BLANKLINE>
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_pytests(cave)

The only difference to the example before is, that we use
`register_pytests` instead of `register_doctests`. If we run this
setup with the testrunner, one test should be found and executed. This
time we pass the `-vv` option to the testrunner, to get some more
information from the run::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath, '-vv',
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short3$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running tests at level 1
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Running:
     testFoo (z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.file1.TestTest)
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    False


Modified short setups
---------------------

The default settings of test setups might serve for plain testing
environments. Especially for functional tests, however, one often want
to set some basic values not foreseeable by default. Here some hints,
how default settings can be tweaked.

Setting ZCML config file for functional tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functional tests often require ZCML registration of components to make
sense. For example one wants to register permissions etc. for use with
a testbrowser. In other words: often one wants to register a custom
ZCML layer when running functional doctests. This can be archieved as
follows:

We wrote a (more or less empty) ZCML config file in the ``cave``
package, which we want to be registered with functional doctests. To
do that, we use the now well-known ``register_all_tests`` function,
but give a ZCML file path and a layer name as arguments::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short4.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests(
        'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave',
        zcml_config='sampleftesting.zcml',
        layer_name = 'SampleLayer')

This will result in::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short4$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.SampleLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.SampleLayer in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.SampleLayer ... not supported
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 4 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False

Apparently now the custom ZCML file in the ``cave`` package was used.

We can add an allow_teardown=True option, this allows the test mechanism
to tear down the functional layers:

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_teardown.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests(
        'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave',
        zcml_config='sampleftesting.zcml',
        layer_name = 'SampleLayer',
        allow_teardown=False)
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_teardown$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.SampleLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.SampleLayer in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.SampleLayer ...
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 4 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False


Setting output checkers for doctests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Output checkers modify the way, output of tests is recognized. This is
important for output which can not be foreseen exactly, timestamps for
example, or local file paths. In this case sometimes a regular
expression would match every single expression, but how can I tell the
testrunner, that all timestamps of the form 'N.NNN seconds' are
acceptable? Easy: use a checker::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short5.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import re
    from zope.testing import renormalizing
    import z3c.testsetup
    mychecker = renormalizing.RENormalizing([
        (re.compile('[0-9]*[.][0-9]* seconds'),
         '<SOME NUMBER OF> seconds'),
        (re.compile('at 0x[0-9a-f]+'), 'at <SOME ADDRESS>'),
        ])
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests(
        'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave',
        checker = mychecker,
        extensions = ['.chk',],
        regexp_list = ['.*checker.*',],
        )

This setup will find exactly one testfile, the file
``checkertest.chk`` in the ``cave`` package, that checks for output of
the form 'N.NNN seconds', with an arbitrary number of numbers. The
doctestfile will serve as both, a usual unit doctest and as a
functional doctest too.

The doctestfile looks like this:

    >>> content = open(os.path.join(cavepath, 'checkertest.chk'), 'r').read()
    >>> print '\n'.join(['| ' + x for x in content.split('\n')])
    | ============
    | Checker test
    | ============
    |
    | :Test-Layer: checker
    |
    | First we check, whether the <SOME NUMBER OF> term is matched by the
    | modified checker::
    |
    |   >>> print "%s seconds" % 0.123
    |   <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds
    |
    | Then we check the <SOME ADDRESS> term::
    |
    |   >>> print "A memory address at 0x1a0322ff"
    |   A memory address at <SOME ADDRESS>
    |
    | That's it.
    |


Running the testrunner with this setup will result in::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short5$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer ...
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in 0.000 seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in 0.000 seconds.
    Total: 2 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False

The same setup, but without a modified checker will deliver::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short6$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)

    True

Note that in older versions of `z3c.testsetup` checkers were supported
for functional doctests only.


Setting globals for doctests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a testsuite you can define a set of globals, which are applied to
each test before it runs. Normally one uses such globals, to have
certain functions or objects available, which are complex to setup
during tests but useful.

The objects and functions registered this way can then be used by
their names in tests out-of-the-box.

You can pass the globals for a testsetup by passing the ``globs``
keyword parameter or ``fglobs``/``uglobs``, if you only want them to
be applied to either functional or unit doctests.

If you specify a `globs` parameter and a `fglobs` or `uglobs`
parameter, the latter will shadow the `globs` values. So `globs` will
have no effect, if you specify also both, `fglobs` and `uglobs`.

An example of the ``globs`` usage can be found in
``samplesetup_short7`` of the ``cave`` package::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short7.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import os
    from zope.testing import renormalizing
    import z3c.testsetup
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests(
        'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave',
        extensions = ['.chk',],
        fregexp_list = [':Test-Layer:.*globs.*',],
        globs = {
            'basename' : os.path.basename
        }
        )

Here the ``os.path.basename`` function is registered under the name
'basename' and should be usable in the doctest file
``globstest.chk``::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath, '-f',
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short7$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup....doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup....doctesting.FunctionalLayer in ... seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup....doctesting.FunctionalLayer ...
    False

The testrunner finished without any error. So the ``basename``
function was indeed known to the doctest and could be used.

The same should happen, if we use the ``fglobs`` argument instead of
``globs``::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short8.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import os
    ...
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests(
        'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave',
        extensions = ['.chk',],
        fregexp_list = [':Test-Layer:.*globs.*',],
        fglobs = {
            'basename' : os.path.basename
        }
        )

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath, '-f',
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short8$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup....doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
    ...
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    ...
    False

Finally, we can register the same doctestfile as unit doctest, such
making sure, that also unit doctests globals can be set, using the
``uglobs`` keyword parameter::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short9.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import os
    ...
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_all_tests(
        'z3c.testsetup.tests.cave',
        extensions = ['.chk',],
        uregexp_list = [':Test-Layer:.*globs.*',],
        uglobs = {
            'basename' : os.path.basename
        }
        )

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath, '-u',
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short9$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    False




Extended setups
---------------

Let's have a look at the test setup module `samplesetup1` in the
`cave` package::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup1.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import unittest
    import z3c.testsetup
    from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave # The package that contains
                                         # the doctest files
    def test_suite():
        suite = unittest.TestSuite()
        suite.addTest( # Add all unittests from `cave`
            z3c.testsetup.UnitDocTestSetup(cave).getTestSuite())
        suite.addTest( # Add all functional tests from `cave`
            z3c.testsetup.FunctionalDocTestSetup(cave).getTestSuite())
        return suite


As we see, there is a unittest setup and a functional test setup
initialized. Both collect one kind of tests and feed their collection
in the same testsuite (where each kind of tests is setup differently,
of course).

Now let's run a testrunner and see the result. The testrunner will be
configured such, that all files named 'samplesetup1.py' will be asked
to return a testsuite::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup1$',
    ...     ]
    >>> from z3c.testsetup import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c.testsetup.functional.doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup...doctesting.FunctionalLayer ...
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down zope.testing.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 3 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False

We ran one unittest and two functional tests.


z3c.testsetup and layers
------------------------

Here we discuss complete testsetups that involve test layers. Test
layers are a method to group several tests or test suites in groups.

Layers are a method to do time-consuming setups like initializing
databases or whatever only once for a whole bunch of tests. Such you
can save time and make your testing setup less error-prone.

See `layered_cave/layer.py` for examples of working layers. We will
use the layers defined there in the following examples.

Simple unit doctests with layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using z3c.testsetup, we can define quite complex testsetups with only
two lines of code::

    >>> import os
    >>> import z3c.testsetup
    >>> pkgpath = os.path.dirname(z3c.testsetup.__file__)
    >>> cavepath = os.path.join(pkgpath, 'tests', 'layered_cave')
    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'layeredsetup01.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    from z3c.testsetup import register_all_tests
    test_suite = register_all_tests('z3c.testsetup.tests.layered_cave')

This means, that we want to register all tests (doctests and 'normal'
python tests) from the ``layered_cave`` package, whose name we passed in
dotted name notation as a string. This is enough information for a
testrunner.

In one of the test files we declared, that a layer should be used::

    >>> testfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'adoctest.txt')
    >>> print open(testfile, 'r').read()
    This is a doctest
    =================
    <BLANKLINE>
    This doctest will be applied to a layer.
    <BLANKLINE>
    :Test-Layer: unit
    :Test-Layerdef: z3c.testsetup.tests.layered_cave.layer.UnitLayer1
    ...

The line saying `:Test-Layerdef:` tells, that we want the layer
denoted by the trailing dotted name should be applied to the tests of
the file. It is vital that the denoted object really exist. The format
of the layer declaration is::

  :test-layerdef: <dotted.name.of.layer.definition>

where the marker string can be written in upper or lower or mixed
case. Doing so, the testrunner will apply the declared layer to our
tests.

To make things more interesting we also created two subpackages in our
package, named ``foo`` and ``bar``. Both contain functional doctests
that need separate ZCML code for initialization and use the default
layer. Although both ZCML files are called ``ftesting.zcml`` the
setups will run isolated from each other::

    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath, '-f',
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^layeredsetup01$',
    ...     ]
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running z3c....DefaultZCMLLayer [.../bar/ftesting.zcml] tests:
      Set up z3c....DefaultZCMLLayer [.../bar/ftesting.zcml] in 0.027 seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.002 seconds.
    Running z3c....DefaultZCMLLayer [.../foo/ftesting.zcml] tests:
      Tear down z3c....DefaultZCMLLayer [.../bar/ftesting.zcml] ... not supported
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up z3c....DefaultZCMLLayer [.../foo/ftesting.zcml] in 0.055 seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.015 seconds.
      Tear down z3c....DefaultZCMLLayer [.../foo/ftesting.zcml] ... not supported
    Running z3c....FunctionalLayer1 tests:
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up z3c....FunctionalLayer1 in 0.040 seconds.
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.011 seconds.
      Tear down z3c....FunctionalLayer1 in 0.000 seconds.
    Running z3c....UnitLayer1 tests:
      Running in a subprocess.
      Set up z3c....UnitLayer1 in 0.000 seconds.
        Running testSetUp of UnitLayer1
        Running testTearDown of UnitLayer1
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.010 seconds.
      Tear down z3c....UnitLayer1 in 0.000 seconds.
    Total: 4 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in 6.014 seconds.
    False

As we can see, the layer `UnitLayer1` was executed here.

Convenience stuff for testers of z3c.testsetup
==============================================

Here we collect some convenience stuff, that might be useful for
testers. Most people, however, won't need them.

``z3c.testsetup.testrunner``
----------------------------

With `zope.testing`_ 3.7.3 the behaviour of
`zope.testing.testrunner.run()` changed and now exits always with
status. See http://svn.zope.org/zope.testing/?rev=99366&view=rev

To run testrunners as part of tests, one now has to use
`testrunner.run_internal()` instead of `testrunner.run()`. This makes
it hard to test with packages, that sometimes use `zope.testing`_
>= 3.7.3 but are also used with `zope.testing`_ < 3.7.3.

For those cases (i.e. where testrunners are run as part of tests
themselves) `z3c.testsetup` now offers the convenience functions
`testrunner.run()` and `testrunner.run_internal()` that are wrappers
guaranteed to be aliases for the same function of `zope.testing`:
``zope.testing.testrunner.run_internal()`` if it exists or
``zope.testing.testrunner.run()`` otherwise.

In doctests you now can use

   >>> from z3c.testsetup import testrunner

call ``testrunner.run()`` afterwards and it will work, regardless of
what version of `zope.testing` you are using.

This is only interesting for people that run tests, which itself run
testrunners (like `z3c.testsetup` itself in self-tests).

The functions provided by the faked testrunners of z3c.testsetup refer
to the same thing:

    >>> from z3c.testsetup import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run is testrunner.run_internal
    True

If `zope.testing`_ >= 3.7.3 is running in background, both functions
refer to `zope.testing.testrunner.run_internal`:

    >>> import pkg_resources
    >>> info = pkg_resources.get_distribution('zope.testing')
    >>> version = tuple(info.version.split('.'))
    >>> new_version = (version > ('3', '7', '2'))

    >>> from zope.testing.testrunner import run
    >>> not new_version or (testrunner.run is not run)
    True

Otherwise both functions refer to `zope.testing.testrunner.run()`:

    >>> (run is testrunner.run_internal) or new_version
    True
