=============================
z3c.testsetup and testrunners
=============================

Here we discuss complete test setups for the `cave` package contained
in thie `tests` directory. We will run the `zope.testing.testrunner`
and examine their output.

Short setups
------------

Using z3c.testsetup, we can define quite complex testsetups with only
two lines of code::

    >>> import os
    >>> cavepath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'tests', 'cave')
    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short1.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    <BLANKLINE>
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_doctests('z3c.testsetup.tests.cave')

This means, that we want to register all doctests from the ``cave``
package, whose name we passed in dotted name notation as a
string. This is enough information for a testrunner::

    >>> import sys
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short1$',
    ...     ]
    >>> sys.argv = 'test '.split()
    >>> from zope.testing import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running unit tests:
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Running z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer in ... seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer ... not supported
    Total: 3 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in ... seconds.
    False

In the above setup the handled package was given as a string with
dotted name notation. We can instead also pass the package itself, if
it was loaded before. This results in a slight longer example::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short2.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave
    <BLANKLINE>
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_doctests(cave)


Here we register all doctests from the ``cave`` module. Let's start a
testrunner with this setup::

    >>> import sys
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short2$',
    ...     ]
    >>> sys.argv = 'test '.split()
    >>> from zope.testing import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running unit tests:
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Running z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer in ... seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer ... not supported
    Total: 3 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in ... seconds.
    False

Now let's run a suite of 'normal' python unit tests, i.e. tests, that
are not doctests. An appropriate setup file might look like this::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup_short3.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import z3c.testsetup
    from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave
    <BLANKLINE>
    test_suite = z3c.testsetup.register_pytests(cave)


The only difference to the example before is, that we use
`register_pytests` instead of `register_doctests`. If we run this
setup with the testrunner, one test should be found and executed. This
time we pass the `-vv` option to the testrunner, to get some more
information from the run::

    >>> import sys
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup_short3$',
    ...     ]
    >>> sys.argv = 'test -vv'.split()
    >>> from zope.testing import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running tests at level 1
    Running unit tests:
      Running:
     testFoo (z3c.testsetup.tests.cave.file1.TestTest)
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    False


Extended setups
---------------

Let's have a look at the test setup module `samplesetup1` in the
`cave` package::

    >>> setupfile = os.path.join(cavepath, 'samplesetup1.py')
    >>> print open(setupfile).read()
    import unittest
    import z3c.testsetup
    from z3c.testsetup.tests import cave # The package that contains
                                         # the doctest files
    def test_suite():
        suite = unittest.TestSuite()
        suite.addTest( # Add all unittests from `cave`
            z3c.testsetup.UnitDocTestSetup(cave).getTestSuite())
        suite.addTest( # Add all functional tests from `cave`
            z3c.testsetup.FunctionalDocTestSetup(cave).getTestSuite())
        return suite


As we see, there is a unittest setup and a functional test setup
initialized. Both collect one kind of tests and feed their collection
in the same testsuite (where each kind of tests is setup differently,
of course). 

Now let's run a testrunner and see the result. The testrunner will be
configured such, that all files named 'samplesetup1.py' will be asked
to return a testsuite::

    >>> import sys
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', cavepath,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^samplesetup1$',
    ...     ]
    >>> sys.argv = 'test '.split()
    >>> from zope.testing import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)
    Running unit tests:
      Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Running z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer tests:
      Set up z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer in ... seconds.
      Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in ... seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down z3c.testsetup.doctesting.FunctionalLayer ... not supported
    Total: 3 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in ... seconds.
    False

We ran one unittest and two functional tests.
