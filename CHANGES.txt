0.3 (unreleased)
================

Bug fixes
---------

* Updated doctest examples to reflect new ``zope.testing`` behaviour.

* ``z3c.testsetup`` really shouldn't require ``zope.app.testing`` any
  more. If you use it in an environment without this package, then you
  cannot register functional tests, which is determined when loading
  ``register_all_tests`` from ``z3c.testsetup``.

* Broken modules are ignored while scanning for tests.

* Modules are not loaded anymore if their source code does not provide
  a suitable marker string. For this to work, the default checker
  method ``isTestModule`` now expects a ``martian.scan.ModuleInfo`` as
  argument and not a real module. Module infos can be easily created
  by using ``module_info_from_dotted_name`` and
  ``module_info_from_package`` from the ``martian.scan`` package.


0.2.2 (2008-02-29)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* ``z3c.testsetup`` now does not require ``zope.component`` nor
  ``zope.app.testing`` for usage in other packages. You must take
  care, that those packages are available during tests, for example by
  adding those packages to your `setup.py`.

0.2.1 (2008-02-18)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

0.2 (2008-02-17)

  default layer for functional doctests if it exists.
