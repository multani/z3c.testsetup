0.3 (unreleased)
================

Bug fixes
---------

* Updated doctest examples to reflect new ``zope.testing`` behaviour.

* ``z3c.testsetup`` really shouldn't require ``zope.app.testing`` any
  more. If you use it in an environment without this package, then you
  cannot register functional tests, which is determined when loading
  ``register_all_tests`` from ``z3c.testsetup``.

* Broken modules are ignored while scanning for tests.

* Modules are not loaded anymore if their source code does not provide
  a suitable marker string. For this to work, the default checker
  method ``isTestModule`` now expects a ``martian.scan.ModuleInfo`` as
  argument and not a real module. Module infos can be easily created
  by using ``module_info_from_dotted_name`` and
  ``module_info_from_package`` from the ``martian.scan`` package.

Feature Changes
---------------

* New set of testfile markers:

  - `:doctest:`

    marks a testfile as a doctest.

  - `:unittest:`

    marks a testfile as a regular unittest.

  - `:layer: dotted.name.to.layer.def`

    applies the given layer definition to the tests in the doctest
    file.

  - `:zcml-layer: filename.zcml`

    sets up a ZCML layer with the given filename and applies this
    layer to the doctests in the doctest file.

  - `:functional-zcml-layer: filename.zcml`

    sets up a ZCML layer with the given filename and applies this
    layer to the doctests in the doctest file. Furthermore the tests
    are set up as functional doc tests.

  - `:setup: dotted.name.to.setup.function`

    applies the setUp function denoted by the dotted name to the tests
    in the doctest file.

  - `:teardown: dotted.name.to.teardown.function`

    applies the tearDown function denoted by the dotted name to the
    tests in the doctests file.

  See the examples in `tests/othercave` and README.txt to learn more
  about using these new directives.

  The old `:test-layer:` marker is still supported but it is
  deprecated now and will vanish at least with the 0.5 version of
  `z3c.testsetup`.


0.2.2 (2008-02-29)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* ``z3c.testsetup`` now does not require ``zope.component`` nor
  ``zope.app.testing`` for usage in other packages. You must take
  care, that those packages are available during tests, for example by
  adding those packages to your `setup.py`.

0.2.1 (2008-02-18)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix faulty upload egg.


0.2 (2008-02-17)
================

Feature Changes
---------------

* An `ftesting.zcml` in the root of a handled package is now taken as
  default layer for functional doctests if it exists.
