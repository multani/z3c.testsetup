0.2.3 (unreleased)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* ``z3c.testsetup`` really shouldn't require ``zope.app.testing`` any
  more. If you use it in an environment without this package, then you
  cannot register functional tests, which is determined when loading
  ``register_all_tests`` from ``z3c.testsetup``.


0.2.2 (2008-02-29)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* ``z3c.testsetup`` now does not require ``zope.component`` nor
  ``zope.app.testing`` for usage in other packages. You must take
  care, that those packages are available during tests, for example by
  adding those packages to your `setup.py`.

0.2.1 (2008-02-18)
==================
