Changelog for z3c.testsetup
***************************

0.7 (2010-05-17)
================

- Fix NameError bug in the warning message in case zope.app.testing is not
  availble when trying to run a functional doc test. This error presented
  itself as a highly cryptic ImportError when actually running tests.

0.6.1 (2009-11-19)
==================

- Test files that we attempt to read but that do not exist raise an error
  instead of passing silently.

- Internal refactoring: regex caching.

0.6 (2009-11-19)
================

- Python unittest modules with an import error now result in a visible
  warning.  Previously, such problems would be hidden.  Also the python
  testrunner could not report them as broken as we did not pass those test
  files to the testrunner.

- Fixed regex for detecting the old ":test-layer: python" marker: it did not
  work when prefixed with restructuredtext's ".." comment marker.

0.5.1 (2009-10-22)
==================

* Reverted allow_teardown default back to False to prevent confusion.

0.5 (2009-09-23)
================

Bug fixes
---------

* Checkers are now applied to non-functional doctests too. Thanks to
  Jonathan Ballet for patches.

* Normal UnitTest layers are now registered correctly.

* ``:layer:`` now detects functional ZCML layers. If the defined layer is
  derived from `zope.testing.functional.ZCMLLayer`, then the test is
  set up with the same kind of testcase as ``:functional-zcml-layer:``.

* Reordered and cleaned up the documentation.

Feature changes
---------------

* By default, functional layer tests now use the allow_teardown=True option of
  the ZCMLLayer.  This prevents the zcml layer from running in a subprocess
  which throws off profiling and thus code coverage tools.  Running it in a
  subprocess is only normally needed when you do things like adding an
  interface to a class after the fact in your code.  You can overrid it in the
  register_all_tests() call by setting allow_teardown=False.


0.4 (2009-06-11)
================

Bug fixes
---------

* Made ``z3c.testsetup`` selftests work with ``zope.testing`` >=
  3.7.3. Thanks to Jonathan Ballet for pointing to that problem.

* Ignore \*nix hidden test files (i.e. such starting with a dot in
  filename) by default. Thanks to Jonathan Ballet for patch.

* ZCML files registered via the default layer are now separated from
  each other, even if they own the same filename. Therefore you can now
  register a default layer with an ``ftesting.zcml`` in one subpackage
  while having another ``ftesting.zcml`` in another package. This was
  not handled correctly before. Many thanks go to Jonathan Ballet who
  contributed a patch.

Feature Changes
---------------

* Added ``z3c.testsetup.testrunner`` that provides wrappers for
  ``zope.testing.testrunner``s ``run()`` and ``run_internal()``
  functions. Using it, one can make sure that running testrunners
  inside tests will work regardless of which version of
  ``zope.testing`` is used during testruns.

0.3 (2009-02-23)
================

Bug fixes
---------

* Updated doctest examples to reflect new ``zope.testing`` behaviour.

* ``z3c.testsetup`` really shouldn't require ``zope.app.testing`` any
  more. If you use it in an environment without this package, then you
  cannot register functional tests, which is determined when loading
  ``register_all_tests`` from ``z3c.testsetup``.

* Broken modules are ignored while scanning for tests.

* Modules are not loaded anymore if their source code does not provide
  a suitable marker string. For this to work, the default checker
  method ``isTestModule`` now expects a ``martian.scan.ModuleInfo`` as
  argument and not a real module. Module infos can be easily created
  by using ``module_info_from_dotted_name`` and
  ``module_info_from_package`` from the ``martian.scan`` package.

Feature Changes
---------------

* New set of testfile markers:

  - `:doctest:`

    marks a testfile as a doctest.

  - `:unittest:`

    marks a testfile as a regular unittest.

  - `:layer: dotted.name.to.layer.def`

    applies the given layer definition to the tests in the doctest
    file.

  - `:zcml-layer: filename.zcml`

    sets up a ZCML layer with the given filename and applies this
    layer to the doctests in the doctest file.

  - `:functional-zcml-layer: filename.zcml`

    sets up a ZCML layer with the given filename and applies this
    layer to the doctests in the doctest file. Furthermore the tests
    are set up as functional doc tests.

  - `:setup: dotted.name.to.setup.function`

    applies the setUp function denoted by the dotted name to the tests
    in the doctest file.

  - `:teardown: dotted.name.to.teardown.function`

    applies the tearDown function denoted by the dotted name to the
    tests in the doctests file.

  See the examples in `tests/othercave` and README.txt to learn more
  about using these new directives.

  The old `:test-layer:` marker is still supported but it is
  deprecated now and will vanish at least with the 0.5 version of
  `z3c.testsetup`.


0.2.2 (2008-02-29)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* ``z3c.testsetup`` now does not require ``zope.component`` nor
  ``zope.app.testing`` for usage in other packages. You must take
  care, that those packages are available during tests, for example by
  adding those packages to your `setup.py`.

0.2.1 (2008-02-18)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix faulty upload egg.


0.2 (2008-02-17)
================

Feature Changes
---------------

* An `ftesting.zcml` in the root of a handled package is now taken as
  default layer for functional doctests if it exists.

Bug fixes
---------


0.1 (2008-02-15)
